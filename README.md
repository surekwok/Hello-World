# Hello-World
This is a new world

Hi Humans,

This is a alien, I am trying to communicate with your species, but it is too difficult for me. The people are alway telling somethings called white lie, cheating others for good reason. If you really want to do nice to others, why you lie? Beside this, your species also contradictory. While you human say 'feel free to contact me', the word of 'free' mean 'welcome' right? Then 'feel free to smoke here' mean 'you are okay to smoke here' right? Then what's about 'smoke free'?
Anyway,, you humans are troublesome....

Yours,
Alien
